## üéØ Project Overview

TheRoundTable enables users to host conversations with historical figures, powered by advanced AI and sophisticated character modeling. Users select 2-3 historical figures who then engage in dynamic, contextual discussions based on their authentic beliefs, relationships, and personalities.

**üî• Key Innovation**: Unlike simple chatbots, this system features **conviction-based responses** where characters interject when topics they deeply care about are mentioned, creating authentic multi-party conversations.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend (Node.js + AWS Lambda)
- **Serverless Architecture**: AWS Lambda with Express.js for scalable API deployment
- **Advanced AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o with custom prompt engineering for character authenticity
- **Intelligent Conversation System**: Multi-round discussion engine with conviction-based interruptions
- **Smart Message Classification**: Intent detection for appropriate response calibration (casual vs deep topics)
- **Relationship Matrix**: 50 characters √ó 49 relationships = 2,450 unique interpersonal dynamics

### Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)
- **Modern React Stack**: Next.js 13+ with TypeScript for type safety and performance
- **Material-UI Design**: Professional, responsive interface with custom theming
- **Real-time Interactions**: Dynamic character selection and conversation management
- **Static Site Generation**: Optimized for CDN delivery and SEO

### AWS Cloud Infrastructure
- **Frontend**: S3 + CloudFront for global content delivery
- **Backend**: Lambda functions for serverless API execution
- **Deployment**: Automated CI/CD with infrastructure as code
- **Security**: Proper secrets management and CORS configuration

## üß† Advanced AI Features

### Conviction-Based Response System
Each of the 50 historical figures has:
- **Core Beliefs** (3-5 fundamental principles with conviction scores 1-10)
- **Topic Triggers** (keywords that activate passionate responses)
- **Relationship Dynamics** (how they address and react to other figures)

```javascript
// Example: Socrates conviction system
core_beliefs: [
  {
    statement: "The unexamined life is not worth living",
    conviction: 10,
    triggers: ["philosophy", "self-knowledge", "wisdom"],
    context: "Will always defend philosophical inquiry"
  }
]
```

### Dynamic Conversation Flow
- **Multi-Round Discussions**: Characters build on each other's responses
- **Authentic Interruptions**: High-conviction topics trigger out-of-turn responses
- **Context Retention**: Full conversation history maintained for coherent dialogue
- **Smart Response Calibration**: Brief responses for casual topics, deep engagement for complex questions

## üé® Character Development

### 50 Historical Figures with Full Personalities
- **Philosophers**: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius
- **Scientists**: Einstein, Marie Curie, Newton, Tesla, Darwin
- **Leaders**: Caesar, Napoleon, Alexander the Great, Catherine the Great
- **Artists**: Shakespeare, Mozart, Leonardo da Vinci, Frida Kahlo
- **Visionaries**: Gandhi, Joan of Arc, Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks

Each character features:
- Historically accurate personality and speech patterns
- Unique relationship dynamics with other figures
- Conviction-based response triggers
- Era-appropriate knowledge and perspectives

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Highlights

### Problem-Solving Examples
1. **WSL Git Limitations**: Developed hybrid workflow for large repository management
2. **Conversation Flow**: Built sophisticated turn-taking system preventing repetitive responses
3. **Character Authenticity**: Extensive research and prompt engineering for historical accuracy
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Serverless design supporting concurrent users without infrastructure management

### Technical Decisions
- **GPT-4o Over GPT-3.5**: Dramatic improvement in character consistency and authenticity
- **Conviction System**: Novel approach to multi-party AI conversations beyond simple turn-taking
- **Intent Classification**: Smart response calibration based on message context and complexity
- **Relationship Matrices**: Complex character interaction system for authentic historical dynamics

## üöÄ Deployment & DevOps

### Automated Deployment Pipeline
```bash
# Frontend deployment
npm run deploy  # Builds, uploads to S3, invalidates CloudFront

# Backend deployment  
npm run build:lambda
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name theroundtable-backend-dev
```

### Infrastructure Management
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code for reproducible deployments
- **Environment Management**: Separate dev/prod configurations
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration for performance tracking
- **Security**: Proper secrets management and CORS policies

## üéØ Business & Product Thinking

### Scalability Considerations
- **Character Limit**: Deliberately constrained to 50 high-quality figures vs. hundreds of generic ones
- **Performance**: Optimized for mobile responsiveness and fast load times
- **Cost Management**: Efficient API usage and caching strategies
- **User Experience**: Focus on meaningful conversations over feature bloat

### Technical Product Decisions
- **Quality Over Quantity**: 50 deeply researched characters vs. 500 shallow ones
- **Conversation Depth**: Multi-round discussions vs. simple Q&A
- **Historical Accuracy**: Extensive research for authentic personalities
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design for accessibility across devices
