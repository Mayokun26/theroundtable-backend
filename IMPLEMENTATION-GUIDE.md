# TheRoundTable - Final Implementation Documentation

## Overview

TheRoundTable is a web application that allows users to engage in conversations with historical and fictional figures. This document provides detailed information about the implementation, configuration, and maintenance of the application.

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Material UI
- **State Management**: React Query and React Context
- **Styling**: Custom theme with historical aesthetics
- **Hosting**: AWS S3 with CloudFront distribution

### Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js/Express with TypeScript
- **Database**: AWS DynamoDB
- **Caching**: Redis
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API
- **Hosting**: AWS Lambda with API Gateway

## Key Features

1. **Character Selection**
   - Browse and select from ~50 historical/fictional figures
   - Filter by era, specialty, or category
   - Select multiple characters to form a panel

2. **Conversation Interface**
   - Real-time chat-like interface
   - AI-powered responses from selected characters
   - Character-specific personalities and knowledge

3. **Historical Theme**
   - Parchment-like aesthetic
   - Period-appropriate typography
   - Immersive visual design

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Frontend
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Backend API URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV`: Environment (development/production)
- Auth-related keys for user management

#### Backend
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for OpenAI integration
- AWS credentials for DynamoDB access
- Redis configuration (if applicable)

## Deployment Process

### Backend Deployment
1. Build TypeScript code: `npm run build`
2. Create Lambda deployment package
3. Update AWS Lambda function
4. Configure environment variables
5. Test API endpoints

### Frontend Deployment
1. Build Next.js application: `npm run build`
2. Deploy to S3 bucket
3. Invalidate CloudFront cache (if applicable)
4. Verify site functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Issues**
   - Verify API Gateway configuration
   - Check Lambda function logs
   - Ensure CORS is properly configured

2. **Character Loading Issues**
   - Verify DynamoDB access and data
   - Check scan limits in character retrieval code
   - Ensure fallback character list is complete

3. **Conversation Failures**
   - Check OpenAI API key validity
   - Verify request/response format
   - Check Lambda timeout settings (conversations may take time)

4. **Visual/Theme Issues**
   - Ensure CSS is properly built and deployed
   - Check for missing assets
   - Verify browser compatibility

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **API Key Rotation**
   - Update OpenAI API key periodically
   - Update AWS credentials as needed

2. **Content Updates**
   - Add new historical figures to DynamoDB
   - Update character information as needed

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Check Lambda execution metrics
   - Monitor S3/CloudFront usage
   - Review DynamoDB capacity

## Future Enhancements

1. **Character Interaction**
   - Allow characters to respond to each other
   - Implement conversation memory/context

2. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Filter panels by compatibility or topic expertise
   - Save favorite panels for quick access

3. **User Profiles**
   - Save conversation history
   - Customize user preferences

4. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Enhance mobile UI/UX
   - Implement responsive design improvements

## Final Notes

The implementation uses industry best practices for security, performance, and maintainability. The modular architecture allows for easy updates and enhancements in the future.

The OpenAI integration provides dynamic, engaging character responses while maintaining historical accuracy and personality traits.
